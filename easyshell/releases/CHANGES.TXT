1.4.1 (by anb0s at 2013-04-01)
------------------------------
! fixed issues:
  ! Mac OS X defaults are wrong (Thanks to Mark Phippard)
    https://sourceforge.net/p/pluginbox/bugs/9/
  ! [1.4.0.1] bug: need to escape spaces when invoking nautilus
    https://sourceforge.net/p/pluginbox/bugs/18/
! ATTENTION: added new option "string tokenizer" and set it to Yes.
  Your self defined presets with usage of quotes may not work anymore.
  Please change this option to No or read how to fix:
  ! used solution from Mark Phippard
  ! the whole command line string will be splitted (tokenized) to single strings
    before expansion of parameters {0} - {4} and passing to command line
  ! with this solution there is no need to surround parameters {0} - {4} with
    quotes when space character is possible between command line option and parameter,
    e.g.: /D {1}
  ! otherwise maybe quotes are still needed, e.g.: --working-directory="{1}"
  ! PLEASE check your presets with debug output (error console)!
! changed presets:
  ! removed not needed quotes from all presets, because "string tokenizer" enabled
  ! fixed Run command for "Windows Console / Explorer"
  ! fixed Explore command for "Windows DOS-Shell / TotalCommander"
