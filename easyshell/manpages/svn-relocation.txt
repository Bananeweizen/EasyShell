svn: E165001: Commit blocked by start-commit hook (exit code 1) with output:

This repository has moved to a new location.  This project was upgraded to the new SourceForge platform, so a one-time move of this repo was performed.  There are instructions for switching to the new location below.  You can no longer commit to the repo at this location.

Please update your configuration with the following command:

    svn relocate "svn+ssh://USERNAME@svn.code.sf.net/p/pluginbox/code/"

Older versions of SVN may need to use the command:

    svn switch --relocate OLD_URL "svn+ssh://USERNAME@svn.code.sf.net/p/pluginbox/code/"

where OLD_URL is the URL from the output of svn info.

If you receive an error regarding mismatched UUIDs, or "Can't find entry" see
http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/community-docs/SVN%20and%20project%20upgrades/
for instructions on how to resolve it.
